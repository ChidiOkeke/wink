            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involved designing a poster that effectively utilizes typography and color to create a visually appealing and engaging design.</p>
            <h2>Design Concept</h2>
            <p>The poster, titled "Drowsy," combines vibrant colors and bold typography to capture attention. The flowing abstract patterns and striking color contrasts are intended to evoke a sense of motion and energy.</p>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The choice of typography plays a critical role in the design. The bold, chunky font used for "DROWSY" stands out against the colorful background, while the repeated, semi-transparent text adds depth and a dynamic feel to the composition.</p>
            <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
            <p>The color palette includes bright yellows, reds, greens, and blues, creating a lively and energetic vibe. The swirling colors blend seamlessly, creating an abstract background that enhances the bold typography.</p>
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>The final design successfully achieves its goal of creating a visually striking poster that draws viewers in and holds their attention. The use of typography and color effectively communicates the theme and emotion intended.</p>
